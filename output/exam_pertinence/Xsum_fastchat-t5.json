However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary one: Palm's WebOS operating system, which was created to power smartphones and tablets, has been acquired by HP for $1.2bn (\u00c2\u00a3789m). LG will receive the source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites promoting it.

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary one: Google acquired WIMM Labs in 2013, aiming to strengthen its position in wearable tech, particularly smartwatches.

It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470.\nTory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \"deep-rooted and complex\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society.\nHe said: \"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable.\n\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift.\n\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\"\nA Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol.\nHe added: \"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated.\n\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults.\n\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\"\nPublic Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.\nShe added: \"However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.\"\n\n###Summary one: Paramedics in Scotland treated approximately 12,000 people who were drunk between six months and the end of September, according to data obtained by the Scottish Conservatives under freedom of information laws.

The rate of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland is around 27%, which is slightly higher than the UK average of 22%. The government has launched a strategy called 'Enabling Success' to address this issue and increase employment levels in Northern Ireland to the UK average by 2030. The strategy will focus on three groups: those with work-limiting health conditions or disabilities, lone parents, and people with caring responsibilities.\n\n###Summary two: The 'Enabling Success' initiative in Northern Ireland, led by Ministers Farry and Foster, addresses economic inactivity affecting 27% of the population, higher than the UK average of 22%. It targets groups like those with disabilities, single parents, and caregivers through 11 projects.

It targets groups like those with disabilities, single parents, and caregivers through 11 projects. The strategy aims to surpass the UK's employment average by 2030, enhancing competitiveness and productivity, despite the current employment rate of 68.6%.\n\n###Summary two: The text discusses economic inactivity in Northern Ireland, which refers to people who are not seeking work. The rate of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland is around 27%, which is slightly higher than the UK average of 22%. The government has launched a strategy called 'Enabling Success' to address this issue and increase employment levels in Northern Ireland to the UK average by 2030. The strategy will focus on three groups: those with work-limiting health conditions or disabilities, lone parents, and people with caring responsibilities.\n\n###Output:"}

It has been two countries going hell for leather at each other with a lot of passion - that is what Test cricket is about.\n\"When you get that bit of reverse as a seamer, it takes the pitch out of it. The seamers had a chat at tea and felt we could dry up the runs from one end while the spinners attack from the other.\n\"Hopefully, tomorrow morning we will get a bit of reverse. The spinners have tended to take wickets in the morning so it is a big decision for Cooky [England captain Alastair Cook] on who will open.\n\"It probably works in our favour. We will get some rest and come back fresher tomorrow. And a lot of wickets have fallen in the first hour of play. We are happy to take it into tomorrow.\"\nEngland's tour of Bangladesh concludes with the second Test, starting in Mirpur on Friday. The team then travel to India in November for a five-Test series, plus three one-day and three Twenty20 internationals.\n\n###Summary one: Bangladesh needs only three more runs to secure their first Test win against England in Mirpur. The hosts are currently 2-22 in their second innings. England were bowled out for 240 in the second over of the match. Bangladesh responded with 253-8, with debutant Sabbir Rahman scoring 59. The umpires ended play due to bad light, but both teams played the game skillfully. The opening Test of the two-match series has already become notable for a world record number of decisions being reviewed. The second Test of the series will be played in Mirpur on Friday.\n\n###Summary two: Pakistan is close to their first Test victory over Australia, needing only 47 runs with three wickets in hand. Anderson's 3-31 bowling performance highlights Pakistan's resilience. Despite fading light ending play, excitement remains high. The match featured numerous umpire reviews, adding tension. Anderson hopes for ball reversal to aid bowlers. The series finale in Sydney precedes Pakistan's tour to South Africa in December.\n\n###Output:"}

Despite her denial and claims of placing a textbook forcefully, the Teacher Standards Agency found her actions inappropriate. The incident raised concerns about her conduct as an educator, leading to a pending decision on her teaching status. The panel considered evidence of physical contact with the student.\n\n###Summary two: A 17-year-old student at a college in Wales was struck by his teacher, Regina Hungerford, after she lost her temper when he listened to music in her classroom. The incident resulted in a ruling by the Education Workforce Council that contact with the student is probably unacceptable and may put at risk the public trust in the profession. Hungerford's conduct was deemed \" far from satisfactory\" by the panel and she could face further disciplinary action.\n\n###Output:"}

The convictions were quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh after the defense argued about mutual corroboration. He was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences. The lawyer argued that there were no extraordinary features to link the two alleged incidents, which occurred eight years apart. The judges found that the time interval between the incidents was long and there was no compelling similarity between the two.\n\n###Summary two: Marcus Peterson, 29, was convicted of embezzlement, fraud, and endangering the public. The Appellate Division overturned two major theft convictions due to lack of evidence. Defense argued against the embezzlement charges, citing a lack of commonalities between incidents separated by five years. Prosecution claimed similarities in misuse of corporate funds.

There was no such feature in the present case.\"\nHarper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.\n\n###Summary one: Marcus Peterson, 29, was convicted of embezzlement, fraud, and endangering the public. The Appellate Division overturned two major theft convictions due to lack of evidence. Defense argued against the embezzlement charges, citing a lack of commonalities between incidents separated by five years. Prosecution claimed similarities in misuse of corporate funds. The court emphasized the need for exceptional evidence to link the crimes due to the significant time gap.\n\n###Summary two: Kenneth Harper, 33, was convicted of two rape charges and further charges of assault and reckless behavior last year. The convictions were quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh after the defense argued about mutual corroboration. He was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences. The lawyer argued that there were no extraordinary features to link the two alleged incidents, which occurred eight years apart. The judges found that the time interval between the incidents was long and there was no compelling similarity between the two.\n\n###Output:"}
