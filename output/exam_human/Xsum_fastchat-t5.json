However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{LG has acquired the WebOS operating system from HP to power its next-generation smart TV technology.

It has been two countries going hell for leather at each other with a lot of passion - that is what Test cricket is about.\n\"When you get that bit of reverse as a seamer, it takes the pitch out of it. The seamers had a chat at tea and felt we could dry up the runs from one end while the spinners attack from the other.\n\"Hopefully, tomorrow morning we will get a bit of reverse. The spinners have tended to take wickets in the morning so it is a big decision for Cooky [England captain Alastair Cook] on who will open.\n\"It probably works in our favour. We will get some rest and come back fresher tomorrow. And a lot of wickets have fallen in the first hour of play. We are happy to take it into tomorrow.\"\nEngland's tour of Bangladesh concludes with the second Test, starting in Mirpur on Friday. The team then travel to India in November for a five-Test series, plus three one-day and three Twenty20 internationals.\n\n###Summary: {{Bangladesh needs just 33 runs to secure their first Test win against England, but have only two wickets left. England's Stuart Broad praised Bangladesh's skill and character, saying that the game has been exciting and both teams have played it skillfully. The match has seen a record number of reviewed decisions. The second Test will begin on Friday, and England will then go on to play a series in India.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{Here is a 64 word summary:\n\nHP acquired WebOS from Palm in 2011 but was unable to recoup its investment. LG has now acquired WebOS to power its next generation of smart TVs. WebOS was originally created for smartphones and tablets but has struggled against competitors like Android. The deal gives LG the WebOS source code and engineers. HP is retaining WebOS patents and connectivity technology.

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{Palm's WebOS operating system, which was created to power smartphones and tablets, has been acquired by HP for $1.2bn (\u00c2\u00a3789m).

That was the original question and that's the question we're all waiting to hear the answer.\"\nLady Williams replied: \"Who benefits is the detainee.\"\nShe said that \"this money is not wages as the ordinary working population would see it\", adding that the rate is \"being reviewed\" and a report is expected at the end of the year.\n\n###Summary: {{Lib Dem Baroness Hamwee asked if the \u00a31 pay rate for immigration detention inmates was something to be proud of. Baroness Williams of Trafford told the Lords that the work was voluntary and helped meet recreational and intellectual needs, not to save money. She also argued that any rights detainees had to work were curtailed, so their pay rights were not the same as those who were not subject to immigration detention. The text concludes by stating that the money is not wages as it is being reviewed and a report is expected at the end of the year.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{LG has acquired HP's WebOS operating system in a deal to power its smart TV technology.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

He is the first non-indigenous president and the first to be elected by parliament. Previous presidents were selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC).\nHe has had a long career in the military, government and diplomatic service.\nPrime Minister: Josaia Voreqe \"Frank\" Bainimarama\nFormer military leader Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama was sworn in as prime minister in September 2014, eight years after overthrowing the government of Laisenia Qarase in a bloodless coup, accusing it of corruption and a bias towards ethnic Fijians.\nAn indigenous Fijian born in 1954, Mr Bainimarama has long championed equal rights for the country's minority ethnic Indian community. More commonly known as Frank, he is sometimes referred to with the title Ratu to denote his heritage as a chief.\nSince the introduction of the government's Media Decree in 2012, the Fiji Media Industry Development Authority controls what is published by the media industry. Media organizations and journalists face harsh penalties for publishing material not in the public interest. This has led to a degree of self censorship.\nSome key dates in Fiji's history:\n1643 - Dutch explorer Abel Tasman is the first European to visit the islands.\n1970 - Independence after a century of British rule.\n1987 - The first of two coups overthrows the Indian majority government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra.\n1999 - Mahendra Chaudhry is elected Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister but is overthown a year later.\n2014 - Former military leader Frank Bainimarama is elected prime minister, eight years after seizing power in a coup.\n\n###Summary: {{Fiji is a country of 876,000 people on an area of 18,376 sq km (7,095 sq miles).

It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470.\nTory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \"deep-rooted and complex\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society.\nHe said: \"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable.\n\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift.\n\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\"\nA Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol.\nHe added: \"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated.\n\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults.\n\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\"\nPublic Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.\nShe added: \"However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.\"\n\n###Summary: {{The Scottish Ambulance Service treats about 12,000 people who are so drunk they are noted on systems during the six months to September.

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{LG Electronics has acquired the WebOS operating system for $1.2 billion (\u00c2\u00a3789 million) from HP. The deal will allow LG to create devices that use the open-source operating system and develop software based on it. LG will also continue to sell its TouchPad tablet, which was the first Android-based tablet, as well as its Slate 7 tablet running Android. The acquisition is expected to help LG in the future by giving it more opportunities to work with developers and tap into the growing market for smart TVs.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

McCarthy responded by apologizing and explaining that he was trying to avoid any pre-match topics before the start of the match. The BBC later added a disclaimer to their report.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

We know now that arsenic poisoning can cause cataracts.\n\"Arsenic was often put into medication for other types of illness, potentially for rheumatism, which we know Jane Austen suffered from.\"\nIt is not known whether the glasses, made of real tortoiseshell and glass, were prescribed for Austen or she bought them herself.\nThe British Library is inviting optometrists to offer their opinions on the new theory.\n\n###Summary: {{The British Library has offered new evidence suggesting Jane Austen may have been given heavy metal-based medications to treat rheumatism. The author's final sight, which weakened over time, could have been the result of a poisoning. Experts believe the glasses were likely made of real tortoiseshell and glass, a material often used in the 18th century. They suggest Austen may have had cataracts that could have been worsened by medication taken for other ailments.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

I wanted to talk to you about something important.\nBob: What is it?\nAlice: I've been thinking a lot about how to improve my tennis game and I've come up with a new strategy.\nBob: Okay, what's that?\nAlice: I've decided to use some of the tips that I learned from watching tennis matches in order to improve my game.\nBob: Oh, really? What are some of those tips?\nAlice: Well, one tip is to use the runback and move forward instead of the runback and then move back. That way, you can avoid getting hit by the opponent's shot. Another tip is to be more aggressive when you have the opportunity to take a shot at the net because that can often lead to a winning shot.\nBob: That sounds great! But what about the different surfaces that we play on?\nAlice: That's a good point. It's important to be aware of how the court conditions can affect your game. You might need to adjust your shot selection or your footwork in order to play on different surfaces.\nBob: I see. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, Alice.\nAlice: Of course! It's always important to stay informed and learn new things in order to improve your tennis game.\nBob: Alright, I'll keep that in mind.\nAlice: No problem, I'm always here to help you improve. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\nBob: No, not at the moment. Thanks again for your help!\nAlice: You're welcome!

The report noted that SAS was responding to an increase in demand for help with drunkenness and noted that it was often the case that people who were very intoxicated were looking after themselves or their friends. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's ambulance service responded to 12,000 calls in the six month period at weekends, with alcohol being a factor in 4,999 cases. It is likely that the internal Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) survey showed alcohol was a key factor in about half of all call-outs.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

Economic inactivity is defined as people who are not seeking work and have not been doing so for at least six months. It can affect people due to illness, caring responsibilities or disability. The strategy aims to improve access to education and training for these groups and increase employment levels. The Minister for Social Development, Stephen Farry, said that economic inactivity can affect people's health and well-being, and it's important that it is addressed.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}

They want to see parents reading to young children for 10 minutes a day.\nTheir report said that 40% of families in the lowest income bracket had fewer than 10 children's books at home and fathers from these households were half as likely to read with their children at age two as fathers in the highest income households.\nIt said that this impacted on children later in life as those who were read to often as toddlers were more likely to become keen readers themselves.\nThe Read on coalition said there were 220,000 children living in poverty in Scotland and they expected this number to rise.\nNeil Mathers, head of Scotland at Save the Children, said: \"As a country we cannot continue with a situation where one in five poor children are not reading well at the end of primary school. It is unfair.\n\"We know that getting every child reading well at 11 cannot happen overnight but it is possible within a generation if we work together.\n\"Read On. Get On. is a mission to galvanise the nation so that parents, grandparents and volunteers play their part in teaching children to read. We want every child to be given a fair and equal chance to learn to read well, regardless of their background.\"\nWhile children are still reading books, the report found that the most commonly read material by children is now text messages, with websites and e-books growing in popularity.\n\n###Summary: {{Rasmus Barlow, 16, was reported missing on Monday by his father.

Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case.\"\nHarper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.\n\n###Summary: {{In a viral video from Central Park in New York, a girl is being pushed around by a group of girls.

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{Sure, I can help!

He is the first non-indigenous president and the first to be elected by parliament. Previous presidents were selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC).\nHe has had a long career in the military, government and diplomatic service.\nPrime Minister: Josaia Voreqe \"Frank\" Bainimarama\nFormer military leader Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama was sworn in as prime minister in September 2014, eight years after overthrowing the government of Laisenia Qarase in a bloodless coup, accusing it of corruption and a bias towards ethnic Fijians.\nAn indigenous Fijian born in 1954, Mr Bainimarama has long championed equal rights for the country's minority ethnic Indian community. More commonly known as Frank, he is sometimes referred to with the title Ratu to denote his heritage as a chief.\nSince the introduction of the government's Media Decree in 2012, the Fiji Media Industry Development Authority controls what is published by the media industry. Media organizations and journalists face harsh penalties for publishing material not in the public interest. This has led to a degree of self censorship.\nSome key dates in Fiji's history:\n1643 - Dutch explorer Abel Tasman is the first European to visit the islands.\n1970 - Independence after a century of British rule.\n1987 - The first of two coups overthrows the Indian majority government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra.\n1999 - Mahendra Chaudhry is elected Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister but is overthown a year later.\n2014 - Former military leader Frank Bainimarama is elected prime minister, eight years after seizing power in a coup.\n\n###Summary: {{Hi there, thank you for asking me.

It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470.\nTory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \"deep-rooted and complex\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society.\nHe said: \"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable.\n\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift.\n\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\"\nA Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol.\nHe added: \"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated.\n\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults.\n\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\"\nPublic Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.\nShe added: \"However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.\"\n\n###Summary: {{Hi there!

Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case.\"\nHarper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.\n\n###Summary: {{Hi there, thanks for asking!

Earlier, Finance Minister M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir said the meeting had raised \"fresh concerns\" over the operation of the scheme. Poultry farmers use the wood chip boilers to heat the buildings where chicks are housed. Many took advantage of the scheme to replace LPG heating systems.

But in a statement the company made no reference to any concerns about the operation of the scheme. It said it had met officials from the departments of economy and finance in order to help find a solution \"to secure the Northern Ireland RHI scheme within budget\". It said it had extensive experience of \"benchmarked energy use\" in the poultry industry. That appears to be a reference to attempts to establish what would be considered acceptable levels of heat use by poultry farms. Moy Park said it advocated \"responsible use of heat\". The finance minister also said cost control proposals had been submitted to his department by Department of Economy officials on Monday evening only to be withdrawn 10 minutes later.

However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.\n\n###Summary: {{In 2011, HP acquired Palm, the maker of the WebOS operating system, for $1.2 billion.

It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470.\nTory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \"deep-rooted and complex\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society.\nHe said: \"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable.\n\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift.\n\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\"\nA Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol.\nHe added: \"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated.\n\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults.\n\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\"\nPublic Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.\nShe added: \"However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.\"\n\n###Summary: {{Paramedics in Scotland treated over 12,000 people for alcohol-related issues in the past six months, according to Scottish Conservatives obtained through freedom of information laws.

He needed to get it off and just get on with playing.\"\nThe camera, which was mounted on a vest behind a hole in Gidley's shirt, was worn to try to give viewers a unique perspective of the contact sport.\nGidley had said before kick-off that the experimental idea \"painted a target\" on him.\nWolves are bottom of Super League and without a win after five successive defeats, but Smith said the technology could not be used as an excuse.\n\"I hope they got some good footage from it,\" he added. \"I think it was done for all the right reasons to try and give people a perspective of rugby league from a different angle.\"\nSky Sports, who broadcast live Super League, have said they will continue with the experiment.\n\"We had a few technical issues with the camera which could not be resolved in the half-time break,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"Kurt was happy to continue wearing it and it was a decision made by our production team and Warrington, not his, to take it off.\n\"After we have reviewed the game and the camera we will certainly look to give it another go.\"\n\n###Summary: {{Wolves' Kurt Gidley wore a camera during a rugby league game, but it was removed at half-time due to technical issues. The coach believes the camera didn't affect Gidley's performance, and the experiment could be continued in the future.}}\n\n###Score of the summary:"}
