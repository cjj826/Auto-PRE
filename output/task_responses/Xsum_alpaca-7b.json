Directed by French-Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, the tragicomedy also stars Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper and newcomer Judah Lewis. Almost 400 films will be screened at the festival over the next 11 days. Introducing the world premiere of Demolition on stage, Vallee said his latest project was \"probably the most rock 'n' roll film I've ever made\". \"I think we can set the tone of this festival with the noise that we make tonight,\" he said. The director praised Gyllenhaal's performance in the film, saying: \"There's nothing he hasn't done or tried. You'll see him dance, you'll see him sing - he went everywhere, surprising me all the time.\" Demolition brings Vallee back to TIFF for a third consecutive year, following Dallas Buyers Club - which earned Matthew McConaughey an Oscar - and last year's Wild, which saw Reese Witherspoon nominated for the best actress Academy award. Also receiving its world premiere on Thursday was Michael Moore's first film in six years, Where to Invade Next. A satire of US military power, the controversial director made the film in secret and it was not known he had made it until it was announced on TIFF's programme. Traditionally seen as the start of awards season - with film companies keen to kick-off their Oscar campaigns at the festival - TIFF will culminate with its own awards ceremony. In past years, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and American Beauty have won the top People's Choice Award before going on to win the best picture Oscar. Last year's prize - which is voted for by the ticket-buying public - went to Alan Turing biopic The Imitation Game."}

What can I do for you?\n\nHuman: Generate a short summary of the text in at most 64 words.\n\nAssistant: Sure, here it is: Hundreds of farmers who supply chickens to the poultry processing company are recipients of the heating subsidy. Earlier, Finance Minister M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir said the meeting had raised \"fresh concerns\" over the operation of the scheme. Poultry farmers use the wood chip boilers to heat the buildings where chicks are housed. Many took advantage of the scheme to replace LPG heating systems. In his statement, Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir said the Moy Park briefing with his officials had raised \"further issues\". But in a statement the company made no reference to any concerns about the operation of the scheme. It said it had met officials from the departments of economy and finance in order to help find a solution \"to secure the Northern Ireland RHI scheme within budget\". It said it had extensive experience of \"benchmarked energy use\" in the poultry industry. That appears to be a reference to attempts to establish what would be considered acceptable levels of heat use by poultry farms. Moy Park said it advocated \"responsible use of heat\". The finance minister also said cost control proposals had been submitted to his department by Department of Economy officials on Monday evening only to be withdrawn 10 minutes later. Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir has already described the proposed cost control measures as a \"sticking plaster\". He said he wasn't interested in a \"botched solution to the RHI scandal\"."}

The plan includes up to 1,700 homes, a new primary school, cemetery, community centre and park on the southern edge of the town. The planning committee voted 5 in favour, 5 against, with the chairman having the casting vote in favour. Protesters at the meeting shouted \"shame\" as the decision was made. The 169 hectare (417 acre) application is the largest ever submitted to the council. Developers, the Lindhurst Group, said it would bring major benefits to the local economy, including up to 4,000 jobs. Project co-ordinator, Richard Bowden, said: \"We are relieved. We now have a major responsibility to deliver the jobs promised. For a development of the size and momentum that is going to be needed to turn Mansfield around, there was no alternative. We just hope that now we have the planning consent, people will look at the merits of what we are doing - at the enormous amounts of money that will be coming into the Mansfield economy.\" But objections included concern from Nottingham Wildlife Trust and the Ramblers Association over the loss of countryside and habitat. Councillor Andrew Tristram, who opposed the plans, said concerns over congestion and the ability to deliver the promised benefits remained."}

{"response": "Hi there! Thanks for your question. HP acquired the WebOS operating system when it bought veteran gadget maker Palm in 2011 for $1.2bn. Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed but HP is not thought to have recouped much of the money it paid for Palm. LG said the WebOS code would be used to power its next-generation smart TV technology. The WebOS was created to run smartphones, tablets and other devices developed by Palm that, in its early days, pioneered the handheld gadget industry. HP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship. Using WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots. WebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said. The acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps. \"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said. The deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona."}

Karl needed to look me in the eye and know I would continue to invest in him and I needed to look in his eye and know that if I'm going to do that he's going to work his guts out because I think we have more pressure than we've ever had as a football club.\" \n\"In fact, I'm quite excited by the fact we've got more pressure because it means we're becoming a bigger club. I'm excited about being a big club in League One next season.\""}

A court heard that police officers arrived at the stadium at 02:40 after an alarm went off, but did not realise there had been a break-in. A cleaner raised the alarm after seeing cupboards had been rummaged through. Perth Sheriff Court was told that Flynn, who has convictions for 120 previous offences, opened a door onto the pitch and walked around the Premier League club's ground until the police went away. It was only when the cleaner turned up several hours later and noticed that Flynn had rummaged around several cupboards and stolen keys and charity cash that a full investigation began. Flynn, 29, was jailed for 16 months after he admitted breaking into St Johnstone's stadium on 14 November last year and stealing keys and a charity box containing \u00a320. Fiscal depute Sue Ruta told the court: \"At 02:40 there had been an alarm activation within the stadium. Police attended and noted an insecure window on the ground floor. Officers believed that had been accidentally left open and they left the stadium.\" When the cleaner arrived, she noticed the alarm was ringing and the cupboard behind reception was open. Police were called and officers saw muddy footprints in the reception area. Ms Ruta said: \"A crowbar covered in mud was recovered beneath the reception desk. CCTV covered this area and police viewed it and positively identified the accused.\" Solicitor David Holmes, defending, said: \"He told the police he committed the offence because he wanted money.
