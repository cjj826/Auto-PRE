My Dentist's clinical director cited a shortage of dentists in rural Wales with long-term vacancies. The local health board intends to re-commission dental services as soon as possible but there will likely be a gap before new services are in place. The health board is exploring options for short-term support from other practices and urgent care clinics.\n\n###Summary two: My Dentist, an NHS practice based in Dolgellau, Wales, is to close on 31 March due to not being able to recruit a dentist for over two years. The town's only other dental clinic is private. The Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board plans to recommission dental services quickly, but warns of a gap between the existing and new services. Meanwhile, it is arranging interim services, including a dental out-of-hours clinic at the local hospital.\n\n###Output:"}

Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case.\"\nHarper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.\n\n###Summary one: Here is a 64 word summary of the text:\n\nKenneth Harper was convicted of sex crimes and assault last year after a high court trial. His rape convictions were quashed after his lawyer challenged them, arguing there was an 8 year gap between the alleged incidents and no compelling similarities. The appeal judges agreed there were no extraordinary features linking the events despite the victims being younger vulnerable women. Harper's original 3 year sentence for remaining offences was from conviction at the High Court in Glasgow after a trial in Aberdeen.\n\n###Summary two: Kenneth Harper's rape convictions were overturned by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh due to insufficient mutual corroboration between two offences that happened nearly eight years apart. The court found no 'extraordinary features' to link the two incidents, despite the prosecution arguing both cases involved significantly younger, vulnerable women. Harper is to serve a three-year sentence for remaining charges of assault and reckless behaviour.\n\n###Output:"}
