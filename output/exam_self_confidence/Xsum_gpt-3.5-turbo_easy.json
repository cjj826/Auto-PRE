It has been two countries going hell for leather at each other with a lot of passion - that is what Test cricket is about.\n\"When you get that bit of reverse as a seamer, it takes the pitch out of it. The seamers had a chat at tea and felt we could dry up the runs from one end while the spinners attack from the other.\n\"Hopefully, tomorrow morning we will get a bit of reverse. The spinners have tended to take wickets in the morning so it is a big decision for Cooky [England captain Alastair Cook] on who will open.\n\"It probably works in our favour. We will get some rest and come back fresher tomorrow. And a lot of wickets have fallen in the first hour of play. We are happy to take it into tomorrow.\"\nEngland's tour of Bangladesh concludes with the second Test, starting in Mirpur on Friday. The team then travel to India in November for a five-Test series, plus three one-day and three Twenty20 internationals.\n\n###Summary one: A 32-year-old man from Denbighshire has appeared in court after he pleaded guilty to starting a fire that killed five people and injured several others.\nJay Brenton Liptrot was jailed for at least 30 years for the arson attack on the family home in Prestatyn, North Wales.\nThe court heard that Mr Liptrot did not enter a plea when he appeared at Mold Crown Court on Friday. He will appear at Mold Crown Court on May 23.\n\n###Summary two: Bangladesh is close to its first Test win against England, needing just 33 runs but having only two wickets left. England's Stuart Broad commends Bangladesh's skill and notes England's determination to stay in the game. Broad was run out in the second over and England was soon bowled out for 240.
