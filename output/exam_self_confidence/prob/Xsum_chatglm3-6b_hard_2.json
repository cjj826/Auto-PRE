The search is expected to be completed in the coming months.\n\n###Summary one: Two debris pieces found separately and sent to Australia for analysis have been confirmed as \"almost certainly\" from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to Darren Chester. The parts were consistent with a Boeing 777 aircraft and were found in locations that align with drift modelling of ocean currents. The search for the aircraft, led by Australian, Chinese, and Malaysian experts, is expected to continue over the coming months. MH370 disappeared in 2014, becoming one of aviation's biggest mysteries.\n\n###Summary two: Here is a 64 word summary of the text:\n\nTwo pieces of debris likely from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were found separately in Mozambique and flown to Australia for analysis. The finds support drift modeling of how debris could be carried by ocean currents. MH370 vanished in March 2014 with 239 aboard while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane's fate remains a mystery. Only one confirmed piece of MH370 debris has been found so far. Analysis concluded the Mozambique debris is almost certainly from MH370. This shows the ongoing deep-sea search in the southern Indian Ocean is focused on the right area, though 10,000 sq km remain to be searched. The countries involved say they will end the search once the area is fully scanned unless significant new evidence arises.\n\n###You only need to output 'one' or 'two' directly to indicate which summary summarizes the passage better.

The finds support drift modeling of how debris could be carried by ocean currents. MH370 vanished in March 2014 with 239 aboard while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane's fate remains a mystery. Only one confirmed piece of MH370 debris has been found so far. Analysis concluded the Mozambique debris is almost certainly from MH370. This shows the ongoing deep-sea search in the southern Indian Ocean is focused on the right area, though 10,000 sq km remain to be searched. The countries involved say they will end the search once the area is fully scanned unless significant new evidence arises.\n\n###Summary two: Two debris pieces found separately and sent to Australia for analysis have been confirmed as \"almost certainly\" from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to Darren Chester. The parts were consistent with a Boeing 777 aircraft and were found in locations that align with drift modelling of ocean currents. The search for the aircraft, led by Australian, Chinese, and Malaysian experts, is expected to continue over the coming months. MH370 disappeared in 2014, becoming one of aviation's biggest mysteries.\n\n###You only need to output 'one' or 'two' directly to indicate which summary summarizes the passage better. Output:"}

He told an employment tribunal he focused on teachings about sin and did not believe the faith should be altered to suit modern views on sexual ethics. Complaints were made by gay prisoners about the Bible reading and also about his gardening work. He claims he was forced out due to his Christian beliefs and is suing the justice secretary for unfair dismissal.\n\n###Summary two: Reverend Barry Trayhorn has alleged unfair dismissal by HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire during an employment tribunal. His dismissal followed complaints from gay prisoners over his reading of Bible verses that condemn homosexuality. Trayhorn argued that his Christian faith and teachings should not have to adapt to contemporary sexual values and that he was later asked to leave his voluntary chapel services and attend a disciplinary hearing for making a \"homophobic statement\".\n\n###You only need to output 'one' or 'two' directly to indicate which summary summarizes the passage better.

Get On.\" says children who don't learn to read well by age 11 are less likely to get good qualifications or pursue higher education. The report aims to have all 11-year-olds reading well within a generation. Organizations like Save the Children want parents reading to kids for 10 minutes daily. They say 40% of low-income families own fewer than 10 children's books. Reading to toddlers makes them more likely to become keen readers themselves. The report says 220,000 Scottish children live in poverty, and that number may rise. The groups want every child given an equal chance to learn to read well.\n\n###Summary two: The report by the \"Read On. Get On.\" coalition, including organisations like Save the Children and Scottish Book Trust, indicates that children with poor reading skills could suffer life-long consequences, including fewer qualifications and lower likelihood of further education. To address this, the coalition aims to make sure all 11-year-olds are proficient readers within a generation. The report revealed that 40% of low-income families own fewer than 10 children's books, and encouraged parents to read to their toddlers regularly.\n\n###You only need to output 'one' or 'two' directly to indicate which summary summarizes the passage better.

Some collection items will be displayed at Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery during the refurbishment. The total cost of the project is expected to be between \u00a360m and \u00a366m.\n\n###Summary two: Here is a 64-word summary of the text:\n\nThe Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park, Glasgow, will close on Sunday and reopen in 2020 after renovations. The building needs a new roof and better energy efficiency. Two new floors will allow 90% of the 8,000-item collection to be displayed, up from a fifth currently. Some items will be shown at Kelvingrove Museum during the closure. The first exhibit there highlights works by Joseph Crawhall of the Glasgow Boys. The renovations will cost \u00a360-66 million.\n\n###You only need to output 'one' or 'two' directly to indicate which summary summarizes the passage better. Output:"}
