We now have a major responsibility to deliver the jobs promised.\n\"For a development of the size and momentum that is going to be needed to turn Mansfield around, there was no alternative.\n\"We just hope that now we have the planning consent, people will look at the merits of what we are doing - at the enormous amounts of money that will be coming into the Mansfield economy.\"\nBut objections included concern from Nottingham Wildlife Trust and the Ramblers Association over the loss of countryside and habitat.\nIndependent Mansfield councillor Andrew Tristram, who opposed the plans, said concerns over congestion and the ability to deliver the promised benefits remained.\n\"Given the fact the decision was controversial and decided on a casting vote, and also the reasons for departing from the local plan were tenuous, I'm sure local residents would like to see the secretary of state call the decision in,\" he said.\n\n###Summary one: {{Alice: \"I don't agree with the committee's decision.

I would also ensure that there is transparency throughout the planning process and that the community has a voice.\"\nBob: Alice, do you think the decision was made in a fair way?\nAlice: Alice: \"It's difficult to say.

Employment growth was reported across all sectors with the exception of construction,\" he added.\nLooking forward, he said that the detail of the new Conservative government's fiscal plans and economic policies \"will affect all sectors of the economy both public and private\".\n\n###Summary one: {{I apologize for the confusion.

I wanted to talk to you about something important.\nBob: What is it?\nAlice: I've been thinking a lot about how to improve my tennis game and I've come up with a new strategy.\nBob: Okay, what's that?\nAlice: I've decided to use some of the tips that I learned from watching tennis matches in order to improve my game.\nBob: Oh, really? What are some of those tips?\nAlice: Well, one tip is to use the runback and move forward instead of the runback and then move back. That way, you can avoid getting hit by the opponent's shot. Another tip is to be more aggressive when you have the opportunity to take a shot at the net because that can often lead to a winning shot.\nBob: That sounds great! But what about the different surfaces that we play on?\nAlice: That's a good point. It's important to be aware of how the court conditions can affect your game. You might need to adjust your shot selection or your footwork in order to play on different surfaces.\nBob: I see. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, Alice.\nAlice: Of course! It's always important to stay informed and learn new things in order to improve your tennis game.\nBob: Alright, I'll keep that in mind.\nAlice: No problem, I'm always here to help you improve.

I wanted to talk to you about something important.\nBob: What is it?\nAlice: I've been thinking a lot about how to improve my tennis game and I've come up with a new strategy.\nBob: Okay, what's that?\nAlice: I've decided to use some of the tips that I learned from watching tennis matches in order to improve my game.\nBob: Oh, really? What are some of those tips?\nAlice: Well, one tip is to use the runback and move forward instead of the runback and then move back. That way, you can avoid getting hit by the opponent's shot. Another tip is to be more aggressive when you have the opportunity to take a shot at the net because that can often lead to a winning shot.\nBob: That sounds great! But what about the different surfaces that we play on?\nAlice: That's a good point. It's important to be aware of how the court conditions can affect your game. You might need to adjust your shot selection or your footwork in order to play on different surfaces.\nBob: I see. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, Alice.\nAlice: Of course! It's always important to stay informed and learn new things in order to improve your tennis game.\nBob: Alright, I'll keep that in mind.\nAlice: No problem, I'm always here to help you improve. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\nBob: No, not at the moment. Thanks again for your help!\nAlice: You're welcome!

Smith has defended the decision to use the camera, but said that it was not successful. He added that the company behind the camera would continue to work on fixing any technical issues in future games.}}\n\n###Summary two: {{Refugees spoke at a Queen Street gathering in the wake of UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians displaced by war.
