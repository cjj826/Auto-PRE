Efforts to establish universal coverage have faced opposition rooted in concerns about government intervention in healthcare and the preservation of market principles.\n\nSecondly, the political landscape often prioritizes short-term gains over long-term systemic changes. Proposals for universal coverage face challenges in garnering bipartisan support and navigating complex legislative processes.\n\nMoreover, vested interests, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical corporations, and healthcare providers, exert considerable influence over policymaking, hindering efforts to overhaul the system.\n\nAdditionally, ideological differences regarding the role of government in healthcare persist, with proponents of a market-driven approach advocating for competition and consumer choice.\n\nOverall, while the US allocates significant funds to healthcare, the absence of universal coverage reflects a complex interplay of historical, political, and ideological factors."}
