In 2011, HP acquired Palm, the maker of the WebOS operating system, for $1.2 billion. However, HP has not recouped much of the money it paid for Palm, and the financial details of the deal have not been disclosed. LG has now acquired the WebOS code from HP to use in its next-generation smart TV technology. The deal includes engineers and documentation related to the WebOS. HP is retaining the underlying patents and technology that connect to web-based services. LG was one of the first companies to work on the WebOS code, leading to the acquisition. The use of WebOS in TVs makes sense for LG, as it could lead to a return to the software's roots in smartphones. The acquisition is likely driven by LG's recognition of the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience. HP has also announced its first Android-powered tablet, the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress.

In 2011, HP acquired the WebOS operating system from veteran gadget maker Palm in a $1.2 billion deal. However, HP has not recouped much of the money spent on Palm, and the deal is believed to have been unsuccessful. LG has acquired the WebOS code, engineers, and documentation from HP for use in its smart TV technology.

Examinations of three pairs of glasses belonging to Jane Austen revealed a significant decline in the author's vision, with tests showing an increase in strength from +1.75 in the first pair to +4.75 and +5.0 in the final pair. The glasses, made of real tortoiseshell and glass, were kept in Austen's writing desk, and tests showed they remained in good condition despite their age. The use of heavy metals like arsenic in medicines may have contributed to Austen's early death at the age of 41, and the British Library is considering the possibility of arsenic poisoning. Experts suggest the poisoning may have caused cataracts, which can affect vision. The glasses' strength and the possibility of accidental poisoning with arsenic are being examined by optometrists and the British Library.
Archbishop Justin Welby announced that Easter, the most important Christian festival, will be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April, following a meeting of primates from the Anglican Communion in Canterbury. This has never been activated due to a 1928 UK act, but the archbishop is in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church to make this change happen in 5-10 years. There have been 15 attempts to agree on a common date since the 10th Century. Easter is currently celebrated between March 22 and April 25, but the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, resulting in later celebrations. In 1990, the Vatican approved a fixed date, but agreement has not been reached.
Ulster Bank's latest survey of Northern Ireland firms showed a modest decline in business activity in April, with output and new orders falling after growth in March. The region's private sector activity trailed growth in other UK regions. Manufacturing saw output and new orders rebound to a six-month high, driven by market demand in Great Britain. Retailers reported their sharpest decline in retail sales since May 2012, and the construction sector posted its largest fall in business activity in two years. Despite weakness suggested by the results, companies continued to hire staff, with employment growth reported across all sectors except construction. The new Conservative government's fiscal plans and economic policies will impact all sectors of the economy.

Fiji has a long-standing rivalry between its indigenous Fijian and ethnic Indian communities that has been a root cause of political upheaval. In 2014, Frank Bainimarama was elected as prime minister after seizing power in a military coup eight years prior. President Jioji Konousi Konrote was elected in 2015, the first non-indigenous president elected by parliament. Bainimarama is an indigenous Fijian and has championed equal rights for the ethnic Indian community. Self-censorship has been implemented in the media due to government controls on publishing material not in the public interest. Some key dates in Fiji's history include independence from Britain in 1970, two coups, and the first election of an ethnic Indian prime minister in 1999.

The council will avoid £1.3m in planned cuts thanks to savings from changes in sickness absence policy and energy incentives in schools. The Liberal Democrats' proposal to cut senior councillors' pay was rejected, and the SNP councillors vowed to protect funding for services supporting vulnerable people. The council tax freeze forced the ruling group to make cuts, including funding for deprived areas, street cleansing, homeless support, women's aid groups, and the Blas Music Festival. Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson warned of job cuts and service reductions due to the council tax freeze. The budget leader, Bill Fernie, said the council faced "unprecedented challenges" in setting a balanced budget.
Reverend Barry Trayhorn, an ordained Pentecostal Christian minister, told an employment tribunal he had read 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 Verses 9-11, which includes the lines "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor coveters, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the Kingdom of God," at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire in 2014. He claims he was unfairly dismissed after complaints were made by gay prisoners. The case against the secretary of state for justice continues. Trayhorn, who had been working as a gardening supervisor at the prison, was invited to lead worship once a week from 2012, and often focused on Christian teachings about sin and repentance. He was later told he could no longer volunteer at chapel services and complaints were made about his gardening work.

The Independent Inspector of Immigration, John Vine, found significant inaccuracies in Capita's classification of migration refusal records, indicating that the number of "overstayers" thought to have departed may have been overestimated by up to 1,140 in 2013-14. The report suggests that the amount of "overstayers" in the UK has remained largely static, with the overall size of the "migration refusal pool" at 173,562 in the three months to June 2021 compared to 174,057 in the same period two years earlier. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire acknowledged the need for improvements but stated that changes made by the government have been having a positive impact and needed to be judged over time. The Home Office signed a contract with private outsourcing group Capita to review and close the records of migrants who had been refused leave to stay in the UK. However, Mr Vine's report concluded that there had been significant inaccuracies in Capita's classification of migration refusal records, with more than a quarter of departures in his sample being incorrectly recorded.

Tyrone manager Mickey Harte has stressed the importance of trusting his players to execute their game plan against Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final. Harte believes footballers should be given the freedom to make decisions on the pitch and not rely too heavily on instructions from the sidelines.

In 2015, around 1,000 graduates turned down job offers at the last minute, leaving employers scrambling for replacements. The High Fliers market research firm found that about 20,000 students were recruited, mostly in their final year of college. This gives graduates time to explore other job opportunities if they become available. High Fliers' managing director, Martin Birchall, noted that at the top end of the job market, employers are competing for the same few candidates with impressive CVs and skills gained in college. The number of graduates hired by the UK's top employers rose 3.3% in 2015, with starting salaries remaining around £30,000 for the second year running. However, graduate pay at top law firms, investment banks, and accounting firms increased further.

Lib Dem Baroness Hamwee raised concerns about the £1 pay rate for detainees at immigration removal centers in the UK, questioning whether it was something that society could be proud of. Baroness Williams of Trafford, a government minister, defended the voluntary work program, arguing that it helped meet the "recreational and intellectual needs" of detainees and was not designed to save money. However, Lord Rosser pointed to a Freedom of Information request from 2014 that suggested hundreds of detainees had been paid more than £45,000 for work at immigration centers, and asked who benefited from the apparent savings. Lady Williams maintained that the work was not about supplementing contractors, but former Commons Speaker Lady Boothroyd pressed for an answer to the original question of who benefits from the program. Lady Williams replied that the money was not wages as the ordinary working population would understand it and was being reviewed.
