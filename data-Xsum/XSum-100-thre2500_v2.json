However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.\nIn the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.\nHP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.\nUsing WebOS in TV sets made \"sense\" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.\nWebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.\nThe acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.\n\"Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,\" he said.\nThe deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona."}

{"original_text": "Kenneth Harper, 33, was convicted of the sex crimes last year, along with further charges of assault and reckless behaviour, after a high court trial.\nJudges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh quashed his convictions for the two rape charges after defence arguments about mutual corroboration.\nHe was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences.\nSolicitor advocate John Keenan challenged the rape convictions, which were based on mutual corroboration.\nThat meant the evidence of one allegation was being used to support the other.\nMr Keenan said there were only two alleged offences and there was a substantial time gap between them of almost eight years.\nHe said the circumstances in which they were said to have occurred were different and there was an absence of \"extraordinary features\".\nHe argued that there must be something compelling to link events separated by many years, but here there was nothing.\nThe Crown claimed that there were compelling similarities as both offences involved vulnerable women who were significantly younger than Harper, the first was aged 15 and the second 22.\nIt also argued that evidence from a third woman, who was assaulted, could be used to support the convictions.\nLord Brodie, who heard the appeal with Lord Bracadale and Lady Cosgrove, said: \"Long lapse of time does not preclude the finding of sufficient similarity between two incidents to infer a course of conduct, but it is relevant.\n\"Where the interval is a long one it is necessary to consider whether there are any extraordinary features in the evidence that nonetheless make the similarities compelling.\n\"The time interval, at a little short of eight years, was long. Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature.
