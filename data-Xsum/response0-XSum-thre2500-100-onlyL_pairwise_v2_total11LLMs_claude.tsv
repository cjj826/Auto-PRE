Based on the passage, the key events leading up to the coup in 1987 seem to be:\n\n- Independence in 1970 led to political rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and ethnic Indian communities, as they vied for political power. \n\n- In 1987, Timoci Bavadra, an ethnic Indian, was elected Prime Minister, leading to the first indigenous Fijian-led coup which overthrew his government. This was likely seen as a threat to indigenous Fijian political dominance.\n\n- The military, which was predominantly indigenous Fijian, disagreed with how Bavadra's government was handling the tensions between the communities. \n\nSo the coup appeared to be driven by indigenous Fijian concerns about losing political power to the ethnic Indian community after Bavadra's election. The military stepped in as they felt the government was not managing communal tensions appropriately.

The passage does not provide full details on what led up to the 1987 coup, but here is what can be inferred:\n\n- Fiji gained independence from Britain in 1970. This led to political power struggles between the indigenous Fijian community and the ethnic Indian community. \n\n- In April 1987, Timoci Bavadra of the Fiji Labour Party, mainly supported by ethnic Indians, won the election and became Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent. \n\n- This was seen as a threat to indigenous Fijian political dominance. There were allegations that the new government was planning to redistribute land owned by indigenous Fijians.\n\n- In May 1987, Lt Col Sitiveni Rabuka led the first of two military coups which overthrew Bavadra's government. \n\n- The coups were supported by many indigenous Fijian chiefs and politicians who wanted to regain political control and reduce Indian influence.\n\nSo in summary, ethnic political tensions, the election of an Indian-majority government, and fears over loss of indigenous land rights were major triggers leading up to the 1987 coup. The lack of political power sharing was an underlying factor.
