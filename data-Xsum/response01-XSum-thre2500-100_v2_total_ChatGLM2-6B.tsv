Palm's WebOS operating system, which was created to power smartphones and tablets, has been acquired by HP for $1.2bn (Â£789m). LG will receive the source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites promoting it. HP will also hold on to patents underlying WebOS and technology that helps it connect to web-based services. The acquisition is likely driven by LG's recognition that it needs to make gadgets of all types easier to use and the use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps.

A recent study at the British Library has suggested that the deterioration of the author's sight may have been caused by heavy metal arsenic in medicine she took, which could also have contributed to her early death. The three pairs of glasses, kept in Jane Austen's writing desk, were examined using a portable lens meter to determine the strength of the lenses, which increased in strength from +1.75 to +4.75 and +5.0 in the final pair, making it difficult for her to see well enough to read or write by the time she died. The British Library is inviting optometrists to offer their opinions on the new theory.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has announced that the Easter Sunday date may change in the future. An act of Parliament in the UK allows for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April, but this has never been activated. Welby is in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew. He hopes the change will happen "in between five and 10 years time", but warned that the first attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century. An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then, with the Orthodox church following the Julian calendar. The Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date in 1990, which was subject to agreement with other Christian churches and governments, but it has not yet been reached.
The latest report by Ulster Bank suggests that business activity in Northern Ireland has declined in April, with output and new orders declining.

The report's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, stated that while the decline in business activity in Northern Ireland compared to other UK regions is modest, the country's manufacturing sector continues to perform well.

The new UK transport secretary said resolving the dispute on Southern Railways was his 'top priority'. The SNP government should start to take seriously the concerns of ScotRail staff and get a grip of the situation.

The council in Scotland has proposed cuts of £1.3 million to avoid these budget cuts, but other savings will be made. These include £500,000 by changing the council's policy on sickness absence and a further £500,000 in schools energy incentives. The Liberal Democrats had proposed cutting the pay of senior councillors, but their proposal was defeated. The ruling group, made up of independent councillors, proposed cuts in funding for deprived areas, street cleansing, homeless support, women's aid groups, and the Blas Music Festival. Many local authorities in Scotland accepted the Scottish government's funding deal worth £10.3 billion, but some did so reluctantly, claiming the continued council tax freeze would lead to severe pressure on budgets.
The Rev. Barry Trayhorn, a Christian minister from Sandy, was unfairly dismissed from his role as a gardening supervisor at a prison in Cambridgeshire in 2014. He claimed he had been invited to lead worship services at the prison and was reading a Bible passage on 31 May 2014 when a gay prisoner complained. Trayhorn continued to lead services until later that year, when he was told to attend a disciplinary hearing. He also reported being harassed due to his Christian faith. The case against the Secretary of State for Justice continues.
The Independent Inspector of Immigration has said the Home Office must improve its records of "overstayers," foreign nationals who are refused leave to stay in the UK. The report suggests that the number of overstayers in the UK is not increasing, but instead is remaining largely static. The Home Office signed a contract with private outsourcing group Capita to review and close the records of migrants who had been refused leave to stay in the UK. However, the report found significant inaccuracies in Capita's classification of migration refusal records. The number of overstayers in the UK is thought to have increased by 1,140 between 2013-14, due to the inaccuracies in the records. The report's recommendations will be taken forward, but changes made by the government have been having a positive impact and need to be judged over time.
The My Dentist practice in Dolgellau will be closing on March 31, and the town's other practice is private. The NHS practice has been unable to recruit a permanent dentist in the last two years, and the town's dentist will be unable to provide services at the Mervinian House Family Dental Practice. Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board plans to re-commission dental services in the area as soon as possible, but there is likely to be a gap between the end of the existing services and the completion of the tender exercise. The health board is therefore making arrangements for the provision of dental services on a cover basis until a permanent solution can be put in place, including a dental out-of-hours clinic. The Welsh Government expects the health board to continue to review and improve access to NHS primary care dental services through its 2016-17 Operational Plan.

The number of graduates hired rose 3.3% in 2015, with their starting salary at leading employers remaining at about Â£30,000 for the second year running. The report added that it's welcome news that Britain's top employers are recruiting their biggest-ever intake of new graduates in 2016, but as the job market goes from strength to strength, it's clear that our brightest graduates are becoming increasingly choosy about the employers they join.

The British Library tested three pairs of glasses that were once owned by Jane Austen, the author of "Pride and Prejudice," to determine the strength of the lenses. The tests showed that the lenses increased in strength from +1.75 in each eye from the first pair to +4.75 and +5.0 in the final pair, making it difficult for Austen to see well enough to read or write by the time she died. The cause of Austen's death has been the subject of much speculation, and some believe that she may have been poisoned accidentally with a heavy metal like arsenic, which was often put into medication for other types of illness. The British Library is inviting optometrists to offer their opinions on the new theory.

The Home Office must make significant improvements regarding "overstayers" - foreign nationals refused leave to stay in the UK, as failure to do so could undermine public confidence, according to the report by the independent inspector of immigration. The number of overstayers in the UK is not increasing but remaining largely static, with 173,562 in the three months to June this year, compared to 174,057 in the same period two years earlier. The Home Office signed a contract with Capita to review and close the records of migrants who had been refused leave to stay in the UK, but the report found significant inaccuracies in their classification of migration refusal records. The number of "overstayers" thought to have departed may have been overestimated by as many as 1,140 in 2013-14. The report's recommendations will be taken forward, but changes made by the government have had a positive impact and need to be judged over time.
